# Sales AI: AI-Based Sales Analytics Dashboard

This project is a modern, scalable foundation for an AI-powered sales analytics dashboard built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

## Key Features
- Modular folder structure for components, services, and AI logic
- Ready for charting (Recharts) and state management (Zustand)
- Placeholder services for sales data and AI analysis
- Easy to extend for real sales data and AI/ML integration

## Next Steps
1. Install dependencies:
	```sh
	npm install
	```
2. Start the development server:
	```sh
	npm run dev
	```
3. Implement data fetching in `src/services/salesDataService.js`
4. Integrate AI/ML logic in `src/ai/aiService.js`
5. Build out the UI in `src/components/Dashboard.jsx` and related components
6. Add charts using Recharts in the Dashboard
7. Use Zustand for global state if needed

## Vision
- Visualize sales KPIs, trends, and forecasts
- Use AI to generate actionable insights and recommendations
- Support data from APIs, Google Sheets, or CSV uploads
